# Stopify
[Stopify](https://stopify-100.herokuapp.com/#/) is a Spotify clone, a music streaming platform that enables users to stream the latest music, listen to podcasts, and get music recommendations based on their preferences. In Stopify, users are able to browse songs from a collection of albums, pre-made playlists, and custom playlists made by the user. Users can also like songs, albums, and artists to include within their library page.

Stopify's frontend is built using React.js and Redux to manage the frontend state. The backend is built using Ruby on Rails with a PostgreSQL database while AWS S3 storage is used to store song files, album covers, and artist pics.
